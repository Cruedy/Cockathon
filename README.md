# Cockathon

In this Cockathon, we created a website that takes in adjectives that you want your cocktail to be and outputs a name and list of ingredients of your cocktail.

# Ideation
We first completed a round of ideation to brainstorm what we wanted our website to look like and what we wanted to generate for our future cocktail.

Here are some aspects we included in this project:
- web scraping -> to obtain a database of drink names and ingredients from https://www.thecocktaildb.com
- semantic similarity (pytorch, transformers) -> to compute the similarity score between two phrases, like "summer" and "1 juice of an orange"
- flask -> to connect our front-end to our back-end
